MODEL ARCHITECTURE: Each sub-layer, whether for attention or the feed- forward network, is followed by a residual connection. This involves summing the output of the layer with its input, followed by layer normalization. Prior to every residual connection, a regularization technique is applied. Dropout is used on the output of each sub-layer before it is combined with the sub-layer input and normalized. Additionally, dropout is applied to the sums of the embeddings and positional optimization tasks. Additionally, AdamW retains Adam's momentum and adaptive learning rate scheduling, further enhancing its performance encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks, with a dropout rate of 0.1.

Character level is the one which generates the text character by character and not by words or sequences. First the datasets are got ready by 5 concatenating the texts in “.txt” file. Then the can attend to which other tokens.This is important input text needs to be tokenized.

It The model produces a sequence of output tokens. involves the segmentation of text into discrete These output tokens can then be converted back units, often words or subwords, which are i n to human-readable text using the inverse of the subsequently transformed into numerical tokenization process. representations. Each token is mapped to a unique integer ID based on a predefined I n order to tokenize the entire training set of vocabulary. This vocabulary contains all the Shakespeare, PyTorch library is used, specifically tokens the model understands.Tokens not present torch.tensor. PyTorch is an open-source machine in the vocabulary may be handled using learning library for Python that provides a flexible techniques like subword tokenization (e.g., using and dynamic computational graph framework.

It is a sub-word unit tokenizer which networks. A tensor is a fundamental data structure means it will neither encode the entire in PyTorch.

It empowers the embeddings. model to comprehend and process information Attention Masks: efficiently, considering both the textual content In transformer models, attention mechanisms and its structure. The other important step is to
